<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm M.Nithyanjali, a B.Tech-Computer Science & Engineering student. I'm a front-end developer 
with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world
problems. Throughout my studies, I've improved my skills as a developer by diving deep into various programming 
languages and concepts.</p>

<p>
As a front-end developer, I focus on creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I use HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript to build responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes. I'm also skilled in building dynamic
web applications using Node.js and React.</p>

<p>
I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I thrive on collaborating with others to come up with innovative solutions that make a positive impact.
When I'm not coding, I love reading classic novels or exploring new genres. I also enjoy playing different musical instruments in my spare time.
Thanks for checking out my portfolio. If you have any questions or want to learn more about my work, please feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>
Nithyanjali</p>
